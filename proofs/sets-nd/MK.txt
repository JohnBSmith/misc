(*/note set_equi A class is called <i>set</i> if there exists another class
that contains it. Otherwise it is called <i>proper</i> class, i.e.
a class\_A with ¬set\_A is proper. Theorems [[UnivCl_intro]] and
[[UnivCl_elim]] show that a class is a set, if and only if it is an
element of [[UnivCl_eq|UnivCl]]. *)

(*/note incl_equi The inclusion relation. Like equality, it is formed
by a binary relation symbol, thus defined on the entire class
universe. If A ⊆ B, then we say that A is <i>included</i> in B, or
that A is a <i>subclass</i> of B. Inclusion is a partial order on the
class universe, as [[incl_refl]], [[incl_trans]] and
[[incl_antisym]] show. *)

(*/note empty_set_eq The empty set. It is the least element of the
class universe, as [[empty_set_is_least]] shows. Having x ∈ ∅ means
a contradiction, as [[empty_contra]] shows. According to
[[empty_set_is_set]], the empty set is a [[set_equi|set]]. *)

(*/note UnivCl_eq The universal class. It contains all the
[[set_equi|sets]], as [[UnivCl_intro]] and [[UnivCl_elim]] show.
But it must be distinguished from the class universe, which is the
entire universe of discourse of the logical system. As
[[empty_set_is_least]] and [[UnivCl_is_greatest]] show, the
[[empty_set_eq|empty set]] and the universal class are the least and
greatest element of the class universe. Thus, all classes are
[[incl_equi|subclasses]] of UnivCl. *)

(*/note Intersection_eq The intersection of a class of sets. Note that
M is allowed to be [[empty_set_eq|empty]], then ⋂M is [[UnivCl_eq|UnivCl]],
as [[Intersection_empty_set]] shows. *)

(*/note efq Ex falso quodlibet. From a contradiction,
any proposition follows. *)

(*/note lem The law of excluded middle. Valid in classical logic,
but not in intuitionistic logic. *)

(*/note ext The axiom of extensionality. It states that two sets with
the same elements are equal. Thus, a set contains an element neither
multiple times nor in a specific order, or so to say, it would be
indistinguishable from one presented in different order. *)

(*/note eq_refl States, that equality is a reflexive relation. Note that
equality is defined on the entire class universe. This differs from the
diagonal relation E = {t | ∃x. t = (x,\_x)}. Firstly, E is only
defined on the universal class, i.e. only for sets, but
not for proper classes. Secondly, one has to write (x,\_x) ∈ E instead of
E\_x\_x, since E is a class, not a binary relation symbol. The syntax
x = x, on the other hand, is a shorthand for eq\_x\_x. *)

(*/note eq_subst The substitution schema for equality. *)
